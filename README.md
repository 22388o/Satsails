# About Satsails

Satsails is a self-custodial Bitcoin and Liquid Network which offers non-custodial atomic swaps across Bitcoin, Lightning and Liquid. The philosophy of Satsails is to become a platform for everything and anything Bitcoin. Many more features are coming soon!

We are committed to being open source and transparent and a a non-custodial service.

**Everything that we will build will be held and operated by you. We will either use on device technology or connect you to partner companies. Nothing will be ever stored by us**
